# A Linear Algebra project
this project is a recreation of Gauss algorithm for computing matrices using the direct methode, and getting a vector containing the solution.
# LU decomposition
Also how we can extract the LU decomposition from Gauss method using the encholon form.
# Not forgeting Choleskey LU decomposition
